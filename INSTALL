RPITS Initial Setup Notes
-------------------------
* Install apache2, libapache2-mod-php5, php5-imagick, php5-mysql.
* Restart Apache.
* PHP short tags need to be enabled (this can be done in php.ini or by adding
  `php_flag short_open_tag on` to the Apache config.
* Web server needs to be able to write to the `cache`, `thumbs`, and `out`
  directories. 
  (e.g. `chgrp www-data cache thumbs out; chmod g+w cache thumbs out`).
* The database needs to be initialized with some seed data (TODO)
* Fonts need to be placed in the `fonts` directory. The fonts used in the
  default theme cannot be distributed with rpits, so they are not included.
* You will have issues if RAM is scarce. If running with limited RAM (e.g.
  on a VPS), make sure that some swap space is available.

# WAMP Notes

Dependencies include both the Fonts, not distributed here in, and the initial DB setup, also not included. Both these are necessary to procede at all!

### Basic Setup
* Install the latest Bitnami WAMP -- you can turn off all the optional PHP frameworks
* Create a folder called `rpits/` in the `wamp/apps/` directory
* git clone this repository into rpits
* Folder directory structure should be `rpits/rpits/` -- rename the inner rpits to `htdocs`
* Pop over to the pre-installed WAMP `apps/phpmyadin/` directory, copy the conf folder into `rpits`
* Edit `httpd-app.conf` and `httpd-prefix.conf` to replace `phpmyadin` with `rpits`
* Open `wamp/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami-apps-prefix.conf` and add a line for RPITS
* Delete/rename `wamp/php/phi.ini` and rename `php.ini-development` to just `php.ini`
* make the following changes to `php.ini`:
* * `short_open_tag = On`
* * uncomment `extension=mysqli` and `extension=mbstring`
* * edit/uncomment `extension_dir` to `path-to-wamp/php/ext`
* Restart/start Apache and MySQL

#### index.php should be working at this point, or follow the stuff written on index.php

### ImageMagick setup
WAMP says it includes ImageMagick. It's not configured as a PHP extension, however, so it is not useful.

* Install Imagick:
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows
* Grab the matching imagick PHP extension dll for your version of PHP and architecture:
https://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/imagick/
* Copy only `php_imagick.dll` into the `php/ext` folder
* Add `extension=imagick` to php.ini.
